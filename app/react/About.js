        <h1>The Man Behind the Screen</h1>
        <p>My obsession with tech dates back to my days freeloading bandwidth from my 
        <br/>
        neighbors unlocked Wi-Fi on my old iPod touch (1st generation).</p>
        <p>
          Jailbreaking iPods, pirating free software and all sorts of other stuff my family would praise me for, it all just came naturally to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          That, and googling the crap out of all my digital problems.
        </p>
        <p>Fast foward and I finally realized my passion lay in problem solving and innovation.</p>
        <p>I was torn between pursuing a career in IT or Programming at first but once I delved into coding, I was hooked.</p>
        <p>Aside from being a tech dork, I enjoy touching grass.</p>
        <p>By grass I mean, hiking, camping, road tripping, photography, videography, traveling, exploring new rivers, lakes, etc.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy anime, Redditing, and all kinds of other activities.</p>
